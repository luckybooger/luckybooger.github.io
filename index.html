				<p> Imagine a road made exclusively for bike commuters. Our population is o a significant rise. Our streets are no longer able to sustain the traffic and pollution caused by our American Dream.</p>
				<p>Roads that were exclusively for bikers would reduce congestion, improve air quality, and have proven to be effective in other countries.</p>
